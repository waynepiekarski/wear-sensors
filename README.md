Wear Sensors
===============

This is a utility that shows all kinds of useful information about the
sensors on your Android and Wear OS devices.

Buttons are provided to cycle between all the available sensors. For each
sensor, the id, type, vendor, range, accuracy, and latency are shown. The
raw sensor values are shown in numeric form, as a bar graph, and as a plot
over time.

When used on Wear OS, the app is able to show updates even when the display
is in ambient mode.

See the screenshots below for examples of what the application looks like.
